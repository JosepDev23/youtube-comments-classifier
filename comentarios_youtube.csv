@Zepertix,"&quot;They build their platform from the ground up, why can&#39;t they reap the benefits from that&quot; has literally nothing to do with whether or not it&#39;s a monopoly or not or if it&#39;s good practice. They also forced a lot of other companies out of business or bought them to become the monopoly that they are, so no, not entirely from the ground up. It&#39;s not an argument for them having the right to do what they are doing. Apple engages in non-compete practices to force others out of the market and into using only their products. They then use that to force you into upgrades because of discontinued service, only using their repair shops and stupid things like a different charger for each new iteration so that you can&#39;t use old chargers and now you have to buy new ones. These are malicious practices made to take you for as much money as possible and if they could monopolize the entire marketplace they would. It also does not push them to make their product the best product because if they own a monopoly or have a captive audience via walled garden practices they actually can get away with less innovation because there is nothing comparable.<br><br>An easier way to understand it is internet service companies. They literally make agreements with each other so that only 1-3 services cover most areas meaning that they work together to force customers to have the least amount of options possible. That way they can all be bad options together, have the illusion of choice while they all providing bad rates. They force out smaller providers and monopolize the market. Monopolies can be acquired by a few companies, it does not inherently mean that only one company has it. Apple does the same thing, it&#39;s just more complex and a bit harder to understand because of it. Apple owns over 57% of the market in the USA which is more than it seems like because the android marketplace is diversified by multiple providers (Samsung being the next largest at 24%, less than half of Apple but still a gigantic number). They get to dictate the majority without sharing any of that diversity withing IOS.<br><br>Scalpers being an issue does not need to correlate with anecdotal physical violence either, they are still a problem to the point where on release many sets are not obtainable online and even with buy limits in stores lots of sets are sold out. Holiday event calendars were not available at any of the 8 nearest Lego stores near me for the entire month of December, none were available on amazon or online retailers either. There&#39;s no reason that a December set should be unavailable for the entire month of December.

@TheSculptedBrick,"Boba&#39;s sleeves look similar to Paz Vizsla&#39;s armor, which LEGO also chose to depict with sand blue. While Boba&#39;s are more purple or lavender, both are a muted bluish color that falls in between sand blue and dark blue in terms of color value. I think the inaccuracy is more glaring with Boba because the costume&#39;s sleeves are right next to a light blue, making them seem even darker than they really are. It&#39;s a tough choice. I think the lack of dual molded legs is the bigger issue, but I can understand the frustration over this figure. It just doesn&#39;t look right.

This will free up space in the house which will make it easier to play Tetris with the remaining stuff inside the house - make it look nice.

On Geonosis Jango appears to have a more lavender jumpsuit, but on the Slave I it looks more blue. In behind the scenes material it&#39;s said that there were several Jango Fett costumes, so maybe some of them were more blue and some were more purple. And who&#39;s to say which material LEGO was given to work with to determine the proper source material color. If he was wearing a blue suit on the Slave I, it would be most accurate to give him a blue suit when paired with the Slave I set.

@JackTheLegoGuy-wr4qu,"Ask M&amp;R: Do you think one of the reasons Lego is constantly cutting ends with Star Wars minifigs is because the Star Wars license may work in a different way than others? Maybe Star Wars in 2019 saw that some minifigs were reselling for hundreds of dollars on Bricklink, which in the past wasn‚Äôt a problem, but now Lego owns and makes profits from all of those sales. So they went to Lego to rework their contract where they make a  certain % of the expected minifig value.<br>For example:<br>The Rebels from the Tantive hallway are valued at $2.25, and if Star Wars made 25% of that value, they would get $0.48.<br>But let‚Äôs say Lego wanted to give those minifigs dual molded legs, and that was projected to add $1.50 value to that figure. Even if it only cost Lego an extra 5 cents to make them, they would now owe Star Wars $0.98 per fig, almost double.
